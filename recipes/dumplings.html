        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced  </li>         
        <li> 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion </li>         
        <li> 4 tablespoons soy sauce </li>          
        <li> 3 tablespoons sesame oil </li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, 
            egg and cabbage in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed. </li><br>

        <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. 
            Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape.
             Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. 
             Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li><br>

        <li> Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch
             to prevent them from sticking together; steam until pork is cooked through,
              about 15 minutes.</li><br>

        <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li><br>
